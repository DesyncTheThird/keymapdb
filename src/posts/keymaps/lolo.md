summary: A minimalist keyboard that emerged as a symbiosis of the ideas of the Gherkin and Katana60 keyboards. Gherkin is bad because it is impossible to use when you add a space since it takes up the usual lower row of characters. Katana60 is good for everything except that it is expensive and not made by me.
