summary: "Anachron is a keyboard layout designed for 34-key keyboards, implemented with ZMK. It aims to provide a fast, intuitive, and cohesive typing experience. It is similar to trilayer-based layouts such as callum or seniply, but provides a unique layer design and additional features taking advantage of ZMK. The implementation has been heavily inspired by the work of urob."
