summary: This is the keymap for my Kyria keyboard from splitkb.com. The alpha layout is originally based on RSTHD but it's been modified to minimize usage of the inner index column. Features in the code include runtime switching between Mac/Windows/Linux shortcuts and a custom implementation of "comborolls".
