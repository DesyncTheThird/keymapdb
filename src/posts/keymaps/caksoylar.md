summary: This is a ZMK config for my 28-30 key split keyboards, primarily intended to be used with 30-key Hummingbird-like `23332+2` layouts with optional reduction to 28 with single thumb keys. Base layers include a Colemak variation and the Bird layout (not pictured), utilizing combos for frequent symbols and infrequent letters.
